To compile dired 3.05 under linux, deposit in a tmp directory
the archive sources dired.1, dired.c, regexpr.c, Makefile.

Creation of "dired":
        "make linux"

Installation:
        "make install"                       (standard directories)

Custom install:                              (rescue or CD only)

        "mv ./dired /bin"
        "mv ./dired.man.gz /var/man/cat1/dired.1.gz"      (Slackware)
or
        "mv ./dired.man.gz /var/catman/cat1/dired.1.gz"   (RedHat)

The directory /bin is chosen because of its uniform appearance in boot
configurations that use floppies or a CD rom with live file system. The
file dired.man.gz is NOT a gzipped version of dired.man; it is CAT
format as created by groff. This file has value if groff is not present
on the system.
