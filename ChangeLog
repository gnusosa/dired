------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release version 2.01:

Sat Jun 24 10:53:09 1995  Nelson H. F. Beebe  <beebe@sunrise>

	* Makefile (sun-solaris): In machine-specific targets, make
	$(TARGETS) instead of all.  Add new flags, and new sun-solaris-gcc
	target with extensive GCCFLAGS settings for maximal error checking. 

	* dired.c: Add ARGS() macro and Standard C prototypes for all
	functions. Change many char* pointers to const char*.  Do some
	local variable renaming to reduce shadowing of global variables.
	Add explicit typing of all function arguments.  Use HAVE_xxx
	preprocessor symbols to control inclusion of header files or
	features that are not universally available.  Rename TRUE/FALSE to
	True/False to avoid redefinition clashes with symbols in curses.h
	on several platforms.  Remove unused, and conflicting, typedef of
	bool.  Include additional header files for library function
	prototypes.   Make all file-local variables and functions static
	to reduce global name space pollution.  Change types of members
	lnl and lnum in struct lbuf from short to unsigned long, because
	modern file systems require that, and reorder the members to
	improve memory alignment.  Change non-standard varargs use of
	telluser() to fixed two-argument form.  Parenthesize some
	complicated expressions to improve readability.  Change dired's
	exit code to errcode, instead of 0.  Revise to make dirent-style
	directory processing the default, since most machines have it now.
	Capitalize a few function names (Getcap, Getch, Readdir, Rmdir,
	Select) to avoid conflicts with library functions in system header
	files.   Fix some printf() format items and arguments to remove
	length mismatches.   Add wait_arg_t generalization for NeXT systems.

	* cshsystem.c: Add wait_arg_t generalization for NeXT systems.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release version 2.00:

Thu Jun 22 10:14:28 1995  Nelson H. F. Beebe  <beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

	* regexpr.c: include string.h for function prototypes

	* dired.c (main()): allow empty regular expression in search to
	mean re-use last one.

	* dired.c (main()): add VERSION and -v option.

Wed Jun 21 17:36:11 1995  Nelson H. F. Beebe  <beebe@alfred.math.utah.edu>

	* dired.c (getfullpath()): make temp[] static, because its
	address is returned (gcc 2.6.3 with -O4 caught this long-standing
	bug). 

Wed Jun 21 12:36:32 1995  Nelson H. F. Beebe  <beebe@alfred.math.utah.edu>

	* Makefile: Put quotes around $(OPT) to allow embedded spaces.
	
	* Makefile: Add -DV4P2 for sun.

	* Makefile: Add regexpr.* files.

	* dired.c (getline()): Recognize CR (\r) as end of line too; HP-UX
	returns \r instead of \n.

	* dired.c (main()): Reduce returned screen length by 1 to avoid
	use of status line on 25-line displays (e.g. in kermit,
	only the upper 24 are cleared).

	* dired.c (main()): Add input mappings of common ESCape sequences for
	arrow, PageUp, and PageDown keys.

	* dired.c (match()): Revise to use re_exec(), and add call to
	re_comp() in main() after /pattern has been collected.  This
	restores the long-missing filename pattern search capability in
	dired.

	* dired.c (getfullpath()): Try getenv() for "PWD" and "cwd" before
	calling getwd().

	* regexpr.c, regexpr.h: Add these new files to provide a portable
	solution to regular-expression parsing.

	* regexpr.c: In Standard C environment, include stdlib.h instead
	of using explicit declarations of library functions.

	* regexpr.c (re_compile_pattern()) : Add one typecast in
	comparison of int with unsigned char.


% /u/sy/beebe/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Fri Jan  6 23:46:31 1995
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@eve.math.utah.edu>

Add support for sorting by creation date.  Correct off-by-one
error that made half-screen divider line wrap because it was too long.
Make some minor typographical corrections in dired.1, and clarify
some if-then-else blocks in dired.c.

% /usr/local/src/dired/dired/CHANGELOG, Sat Nov  6 11:27:21 1993
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@sunrise>

Add support for ~, #, D, and U commands.  Correct grammar in help
file.  Remove a useless declaration in dired.c.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Tue Mar  2 08:29:27 1993
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Reduce full-screen display size by 1 to avoid loss of line
at top of screen.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Wed Jan  6 16:44:34 1993
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Add Makefile support for DEC Alpha AXP OSF/1.
Add OPT flag to all $(MAKE) lines in Makefile.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Tue Jan  5 17:18:39 1993
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Increase size of userbuf[] in dired.c, so that long lines in
/etc/passwd do not clobber data outside userbu[] in getname().

% /u2/mth/mthnhb/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Tue Dec 29 14:20:52 1992
% Edit by Nelson H.F. Beebe <mthnhb@snow.usi.utah.edu>

Add support for compilation on IBM PS/2 and IBM 370 AIX systems.
New convenience targets: aixps2 aix370.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Tue Dec 29 13:00:24 1992
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@eros.math.utah.edu>

Add support for compilation under ANSI/ISO Standard C and POSIX
terminal interface when BSD sgtty interface is unavailable, or
incomplete (e.g. for Silicon Graphics).  New convenience targets:
fips posix sgi stdc xpg3.

The Berkeley-style signal() returns the address of the current signal
handler which is used in cshsystem() to restore signal handling; the
ANSI/ISO Standard C and POSIX signal() does not return a value.

The choice between the two terminal interfaces is determined by the
HAVE_TERMIOS_H symbol; when it is defined, ANSI/ISO Standard C and
POSIX code (<termio.h>) will be used.  Otherwise, the Berkeley style
(<sys/sgtty.h>) will be used.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Sun Apr 19 10:49:29 1992
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@solitude.math.utah.edu>

Revise to make MOREPGM settable at compile time, as well as
at run time from PAGER environment variable.

% /usr/local/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Fri Apr 17 17:32:35 1992
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@magna.math.utah.edu>

Merge in separate IBM RS/6000 version into master sources.
Cleanup Makefile and add convenience targets for specific
systems.
Add Convex C1 and C2 support.
Put code under RCS control.

% /u/sy/beebe/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Tue Oct 22 12:58:05 1991
% Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@glab5.math.utah.edu>

Modify dired.c to reduce the screen height and width under DECstation
ULTRIX by 1 to avoid screen wrapping, and scrolling in full-window
mode.

/home/csc-sun/a/sy/beebe/src/dired/CHANGELOG, Fri Jun  7 15:47:48 1991
Edit by Nelson H.F. Beebe <beebe@glab1.math.utah.edu>

Add code in dired.c to use ioctl(...TIOCGWINSZ...) to try to get the
true window size; tgetent("li") returns the termcap setting on some
systems (e.g. ULTRIX), instead of the true current window size.
