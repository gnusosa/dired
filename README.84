3/5/84  4.2 dired

These files represent a version of dired (the interactive directory editing
program written by Stuart Cracraft and enhanced by Jay Lepreau, posted over a
year ago) in which I've made a number of enhancements:

1) A command (E) to go UP from any node, including the starting node
2) "/" command, with reg expr pattern matching
3) Use of C shell in shell escapes
4) Ability to quit dired and be "pushd'd" to the current node ("Q").
5) Commands to print the full pathname of the current file and the current
   node.  This is also done automatically on startup of any node.
6) A command to abort all levels at once. ("A").
7) A visual indication of what fraction of the total files the current
   window represents.
8) Command to toggle between full and split screen modes. 
9) Command to re-read the directory (R).
10) Can now be used on any terminal with random cursor addressing.
11) Several bug fixes. 
12) Some additional minor fixes & enhancements since the version posted
    by me in November 83.


NOTES:

 0) This version has conditional compilation statements for generating a
   "standard" version or a 4.2 version.  The supplied makefile will generate
   the 4.2 version as is. Remove the -DV4P2 in the make to generate a
   standard version.

 1) The default shell for escapes is the "c" shell, and the "Q" command
 generates a "pushd" to the current dir node. If you don't have 4.1 or 4.2,
 remove the "Q" command", and signals to SIGTSTP.  If you don't have the "c"
 shell, omit the file "cshsystem.c", and change shell references back to
 "sh".


 2) It runs best on terminals which have "clear to end of line" and/or "clear
    to end of page", but will work, albeit poorly,
    on terminals w/o these functions, as long as the terminals have random
    cursor addressing. This version, like its predecessor, does not use
    "curses".

 3) Some known bugs: ^Z stuff does needs to be improved. Occasionally
    "t" ing out binary files will mess up the display, but this is less
    likely than before.

4)  These are some path names embedded in the dired source code
    (char dirednam and helpfile); modify these to suit local needs (as well
    as those mentioned in the manual page).
