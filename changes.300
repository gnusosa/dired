DIRED 3.02 and 3.03
  Dired was made internally recursive, no longer creates multiple
  launches of dired to do its work. Charles Moschel: Color bug fix;
  added "ESC /" jump to directory. Memory use drastically reduced.

DIRED 3.04
  Keyboard interface with easy-to-change function key support. Command
  history. Ctrl-Q for quoted insertion into command lines. Moved screen
  height ctrl-F into 'F' command. Added 'S', ctrl-F, ctrl-B keys.

DIRED 3.05
  Added copy and move, cooked shell commands loaded from command line
  or DIREDSET env variable, improved substitutions %%, %n, %f, %d, %p.
  Bug fixes in Makefile, Type(). Changed defaults for keys M, c, l. New
  keys "B", ";" added. Resource file $HOME/.diredset may contain options
  one option per line. New sort option 'u'.

Command line switch changes.
  -h, -H, --, -v    All of these print the version and the help
        message about the command line switches, online help and
        the existence of the manual page.
  -C250 Set incremental file capacity. This number determines
        the minimum memory use of dired and the change in memory
        use as dired adjusts to larger directory sizes.
  -S    Stat calls on demand only. Useful for shortening the time
        required to read in a directory, by a factor of about 12.
        When browsing large directories, this can be an advantage.
  -O    Toggle OFF the pathname and stat display in the lower screen.
  -o    Turn off color highlighting. If using a regular Xterm, then
        color means underline, inverse video, bold attributes.

        characters, documented in dired.1.
  -w20  Set window height to 20 lines. -wf and -wh unchanged.
  -Dx=s Define key x (single char) as shell command s.
  -Dy=s Define internal variable y (2 chars) as shell command s.
